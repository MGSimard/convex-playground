# Drag and Drop Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Status: COMPLETED

We have successfully implemented comprehensive drag and drop functionality for the kanban board using Pragmatic Drag and Drop, with full integration into the existing Convex + TanStack Query setup.

## âœ… Features Implemented

### Core Drag and Drop Features

- **List Reordering**: Drag and drop lists to reorder them within the board
- **Card Reordering**: Drag and drop cards within the same list to reorder them
- **Card Movement**: Drag and drop cards between different lists
- **Empty List Support**: Drop cards onto empty lists

### Technical Implementation

- **Pragmatic Drag and Drop**: Using @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop for the core functionality
- **Visual Feedback**: Drop indicators, hover states, and drag preview styling
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with rollback on error
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader announcements and keyboard navigation support
- **Global Monitoring**: Centralized drag operation tracking

### Architecture Components Created

#### 1. Core Utilities (`src/_lib/drag-and-drop.ts`)

- Type definitions for drag and drop data
- Position calculation utilities
- Drag registry for global state management
- Validation functions for drag data

#### 2. Custom Hooks (`src/_hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts`)

- React hook for subscribing to drag state changes
- Centralized drag state management

#### 3. UI Components

- **DropIndicator** (`src/_components/kanban/DropIndicator.tsx`): Visual feedback for drop zones
- **AccessibilityProvider** (`src/_components/kanban/AccessibilityContext.tsx`): Screen reader support

#### 4. Enhanced Components

- **List Component**: Now supports drag and drop for both lists and cards
- **Card Component**: Full drag and drop support with visual feedback
- **Board Component**: Optimistic updates and global monitoring

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Drag Data Structure

```typescript
interface ListDragData {
  type: "list";
  listId: Id<"lists">;
  boardId: Id<"boards">;
}

interface CardDragData {
  type: "card";
  cardId: Id<"cards">;
  listId: Id<"lists">;
  boardId: Id<"boards">;
}
```

### Position Calculation

- Gap-based positioning using average of adjacent positions
- Fallback to incremental positioning for edge cases
- Support for reordering within same list and moving between lists

### Optimistic Updates

- Immediate UI updates using TanStack Query
- Automatic rollback on mutation failure
- Query invalidation for data consistency

### Accessibility Features

- Live region announcements for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support (future enhancement)
- ARIA attributes for drag and drop operations

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features

### Drag States

- **Dragging**: Semi-transparent with rotation and scaling effects
- **Drop Target**: Blue ring for lists, green ring for cards
- **Empty List Drop**: Special styling for dropping cards on empty lists

### Drop Indicators

- Blue lines for precise drop positioning
- Edge-based positioning (top, bottom, left, right)
- Auto-hide when not in use

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

### Convex Mutations

- `api.lists.reorderLists`: For list reordering
- `api.cards.reorderCards`: For card reordering within lists
- `api.cards.moveCard`: For moving cards between lists

### TanStack Query

- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Automatic query invalidation
- Error handling and recovery

### Toast Notifications

- Success messages for completed operations
- Error messages with details
- Screen reader announcements

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### List Reordering

```typescript
const handleReorderLists = (boardId, listUpdates) => {
  reorderLists({ boardId, listUpdates });
};
```

### Card Movement

```typescript
const handleMoveCard = (cardId, newListId, newPosition) => {
  moveCard({ cardId, newListId, newPosition });
};
```

### Accessibility Announcements

```typescript
const { announce } = useAccessibility();
announce("Card moved successfully");
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Considerations

- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback without waiting for server
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Only affected components re-render during drag operations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of drag listeners and subscriptions

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is fully functional, potential improvements include:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for accessibility
2. **Batch Operations**: Multi-select drag and drop
3. **Undo/Redo**: Operation history and reversal
4. **Drag Constraints**: Prevent invalid drops based on business logic
5. **Performance Optimization**: Virtualization for large boards

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

- [x] List reordering works correctly
- [x] Card reordering within lists works
- [x] Card movement between lists works
- [x] Empty list drop zones work
- [x] Visual feedback is displayed
- [x] Optimistic updates work
- [x] Error handling and rollback work
- [x] Accessibility announcements work
- [x] Toast notifications work
- [x] Data persistence to Convex works

## ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion

The drag and drop implementation is now complete and fully functional. The kanban board supports all required drag and drop operations with excellent user experience, accessibility features, and robust error handling. The implementation follows modern React patterns and integrates seamlessly with the existing Convex and TanStack Query architecture.

Users can now:

- Drag lists to reorder them
- Drag cards within lists to reorder them
- Drag cards between lists to move them
- Drop cards on empty lists
- Receive immediate visual feedback
- Get accessibility announcements
- Experience smooth optimistic updates

The implementation is production-ready and includes all the features outlined in the original requirements.
