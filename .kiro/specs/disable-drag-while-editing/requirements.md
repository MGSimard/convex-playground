# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the user experience when editing links in the Kanban board by preventing accidental drag operations during edit mode. When a user is editing a link, the drag handle should be disabled to avoid conflicts between editing interactions and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user editing a link, I want the drag handle to be disabled so that I don't accidentally trigger drag operations while trying to interact with form fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a link is in edit mode THEN the drag handle SHALL be visually disabled (grayed out or hidden)
2. WHEN a link is in edit mode THEN the drag handle SHALL not respond to mouse interactions
3. WHEN a link is in edit mode THEN the draggable functionality SHALL be completely disabled for that link item
4. WHEN a user exits edit mode (save or cancel) THEN the drag handle SHALL be re-enabled and fully functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about when drag functionality is available so that I understand when I can reorder links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a link is not in edit mode THEN the drag handle SHALL be visible and interactive on hover
2. WHEN a link is in edit mode THEN the drag handle SHALL have reduced opacity or be hidden to indicate it's disabled
3. WHEN hovering over a disabled drag handle THEN the cursor SHALL not change to indicate dragging is unavailable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editing experience to be smooth and uninterrupted so that I can focus on updating link information without accidental interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a link is in edit mode THEN clicking on the drag handle area SHALL not initiate any drag operations
2. WHEN a link is in edit mode THEN the link item SHALL not be draggable even if other parts of the component are clicked
3. WHEN multiple links are present and one is being edited THEN only the edited link SHALL have drag functionality disabled
4. WHEN a user is editing a link THEN other links SHALL remain fully draggable
