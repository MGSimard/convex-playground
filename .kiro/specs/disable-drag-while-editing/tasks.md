# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Modify drag and drop setup to be conditional on edit state
  - Update the useEffect hook that initializes drag and drop functionality to include `isEditing` condition
  - Add `isEditing` to the dependency array to ensure proper re-initialization when edit state changes
  - Ensure drag setup is completely bypassed when `isEditing` is true
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Update drag handle visual styling for edit mode
  - Modify the GripVertical component's className to conditionally apply disabled styling when in edit mode
  - Change cursor from `cursor-grab` to `cursor-default` when editing
  - Reduce opacity to indicate disabled state (opacity-30) instead of hover-based opacity
  - Update hover effects to be disabled during edit mode
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Update accessibility attributes for disabled drag state
  - Modify the aria-label of the drag handle to indicate when dragging is disabled
  - Ensure screen readers understand the current state of the drag functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Test drag functionality state transitions
  - Create unit tests to verify drag setup is conditional on edit state
  - Test that drag functionality is properly restored when exiting edit mode
  - Verify that multiple link items can have independent edit states
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Test visual feedback and styling changes
  - Create tests to verify drag handle styling changes based on edit state
  - Test cursor behavior in different states
  - Verify opacity and hover effects work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
